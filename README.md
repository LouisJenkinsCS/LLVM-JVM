# Pure-JVM

## What is it?

A pure JVM written in Haskell. Currently, it is a work-in-progress.

## How did this project come to be?

This project originally was for a computer science course, called the "Organization of Programming Languages",
where I decided to learn a new language and paradigm and to create an interesting novel creation. This
project is being improved upon further as part of another Independent Study.

## What is the goal of this project?

So far, there has been a port of Haskell to the JVM ([Frege](https://github.com/Frege/frege)),
but there hasn't been a port of the JVM to Haskell. This project aims to explore the
tradeoffs between high-level abstraction and low-level micro-optimizations, such
as performance, space overhead, and executable size.
